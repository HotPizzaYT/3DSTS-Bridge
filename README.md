# 3DSTownSquare Bridge Discord Bot

This is a Discord bot for [http://github.com/HotPizzaYT/3DSTownSquare](3DSTownSquare), but I expect you to figure this out on your own.

To set up, paste your bot token, key and channel ID in index.js.

Only latest version of NodeJS was tested, so please use that.

# Known bugs

Not any at the moment

# How to install

Extract this to a folder, set up the variables in `index.js` and type these commands in a terminal while in the same folder:

`npm install node-fetch discord.js`

Then, when those install, type this:

`node index.js`
